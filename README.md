This is a new project that I will be working on inbetween schoolwork to exercise my C++ knowledge. My goal is to create a chess game that can be played in terminal in C++.<br>
This is an ongoing project. <br>
My goals for this chess game involve a few things: <br>
<li>To create a chess board that will update depending on where pieces are. This involves: <br><br>
<ol><li>Giving each piece a unique number depending on location then running that through to check where it is.</li><br>
<li>The most difficult part about this will be optimizing it so there isn't any unnecessary code. </li></ol></li><br>
<li>To allow user input and check if the user's moves or valid or invalid before letting them make them.</li><br>
<li>A pawn promotion system, and removal of pieces when they are "dead."</li><br>
<li>Determining if the board is in checkmate or check and giving a special output with that.</li> <br><br>
So far I have: <br> <br>
<li>Found a way to make the chess board and update it. Right now I am trying to find a way to do so with as little redundancy as possible.</li><br>
<li>Begun figuring out how to check for whether or not a user's move is valid or invalid.</li><br>
